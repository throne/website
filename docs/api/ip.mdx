### Getting Started

You just need to send a `GET` request to our IP query endpoint.

Public IP Address/Subnets: `https://api.throne.dev/whois/ip?query=XXXXXXX`

### Returned Results

The results returned from the throne IP API will be returned in a format that should be very easy to parse compared to a normal RDAP query. Lets take a look at what results get returned when we query for 1.1.1.1. 

Endpoint: `https://api.throne.dev/whois/ip?query=1.1.1.1`

```API Output title="Example - IP Query - 1.1.1.1"

      "roles": [
        "administrative",
        "technical"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also perform queries for whole subnets.

:::caution Quering Subnets
To properly query a subnet you already need to know the CIDR notation of the subnet. If you attempt to query a subnet with an incorrect CIDR notation you will receive an `invalid_query` error.
