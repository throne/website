### Getting Started

You just need to send a `GET` request to our ASN query endpoint.

Domains: `https://api.throne.dev/whois/asn?query=XXXX`

### Returned Results

The results returned from the throne ASN API will be returned in a format that should be very easy to parse compared to a normal RDAP query. Lets take a look at what results get returned when we query for AS69. 

Endpoint: `https://api.throne.dev/whois/asn?query=69`

:::caution Private ASNs
Our API will not allow you to query any private ASN space. You will receive an error with reference to the appropriate RFC for that slice of private ASN space.
:::

Here is a list of possible errors and their descriptions you will encounter when querying private ASNs.

* AS0 (autnum_reserved)
  * The ASN queried is reserved by IANA, see RFC7607
