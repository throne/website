Ahh, so you're interested in using our API huh? Well lucky for you it's public, no API key or credentials needed (*for most queries*).

All API queries will need to be sent to `api.throne.dev`. Visiting that root domain will send you directly back to our throne.dev site so no point in attempting to go there now ðŸ˜‰.

A list of our endpoints are below:
* [GET - `/api/whois`](/docs/throne-api-whois)
