Starting in v0.4.0, the API module has been introduced. This allows you to authenticate to the throne API to perform functions such as WHOIS, ASN and IP lookups.

Also starting in v0.4.0, authentication is required to perform some functions, you will need to authenticate using this module for certain items to work.

```bash
[user@throne ~]$ throne api --help
Usage: throne api [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Retrieve API keys from the throne API

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  get  Use this command to get your username to the throne API.
  set  Use this command to login to the throne API and set your API key
```

### api set

Using `throne api set` you can retrieve your key from our authentication servers. This is in the form of a Bearer token, this command will automatically create our config file and set your Bearer token within the file.

You may run this command directly and be prompted for credentials OR you can use options. See both examples below.

:::caution Time Limit
As of this addition (10/15/21), you will need to re-run this command every 30 days. You my also re-run it at anytime ahead of 30 days to refresh your token.
:::

```bash title="Prompt"
[user@throne ~]$ throne api set
Username: testuser@throne.dev
Password: 
Do you wish to set a scope? (Y/N): N
Successfully set throne API key.
```

:::caution API Scopes
Unless you've already been instructed by our staff to use a scope, always choose N (or n) when being prompted for scope. If you choose Y (or y) and set a scope it will have no effect.
:::

```bash title="Options"
[user@throne ~]$ throne api set -u testuser@throne.dev -p Sup3rS3cr3tS3cur3P@55w0rd!
Successfully set throne API key.
```

While using options, if you have a scope it may be set by using the `-s` option.

### Configuration File 

As used with the Shodan module, we upon running this command we create a `.throne` folder in your home directory which will contain a config.yml file. This file will contain your throne API key when set as well as your Shodan API key when set (if applicable).

```YAML title="Example Config File"
throne_username: test@example.com
throne_key: Bearer eyJsdfSDFSEfdscvsdvw243rfdadsJ9eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3Rocm9uZS1wcm9kLnVzLmF1dGgwLmNvbS8iLCJzdWIiOiJhdXRoMHw2MTI3YjE1YjhmYzRiYTAwNzFDExN2EiLCJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS50aHJvbmUuZGV2IiwiaWF0IjoxNjMwNDMxNTAxLCJl
shodan_key: XXXXXXXXXsdfsdwererw23123dsfzxc
```

This configuration file may be changed as you see fit however commands within the CLI tool may overwrite any changes you manually make to the file. We advise __NOT__ changing this file manually.
