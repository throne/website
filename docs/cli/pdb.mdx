throne has the ability to query the PeeringDB API to provide information on networks, organizations and IXs registered with them.

```bash title="Help"
[user@throne ~]$ throne pdb
Usage: throne pdb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Retrieve information from PeeringDB.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  asn  Retrieves information about an organization by AS#.
  fac  Returns facility search output from PeeringDB.
  ix   Returns IX search output from PeeringDB.
```

### pdb asn

Currently the functionality of this command is pretty limited. `pdb asn` is designed to return information of an organization registered with PeeringDB based upon
AS number. When you provide an AS number as the argument it only returns the specific ID, name, last created, last updated and current status of the object in PeeringDB.

```bash text="Example"
[user@throne ~]$ throne pdb asn 20473
---PeeringDB Information---
Id: 1051
Name: Choopa, LLC
Created: 2006-05-02T08:20:54Z
Updated: 2016-03-14T20:34:28Z
Status: ok

Some results may have been ommited due to having no value.
```

You can see in the above output that throne does tell you it will ommit values that get returned which have no value. Increased functionality of this command may
come in the future.

### pdb ix

Unlike the `pdb asn` command this one provides some really good output. `pdb ix` provides information of IXs returned based upon the query that is made. There is
also is two options you can use as well as one argument that is required with this.

```bash title="Help"
[user@throne ~]$ throne pdb ix --help
Usage: throne pdb ix [OPTIONS] IX

  Returns IX search output from PeeringDB.

Options:
  -u, --unformatted   Returns output unformatted.
  -c, --count NUMBER  Changes the number of results returned.  [default: 3]
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```

Using `-c`/`--count` will change the number of results returned. Based upon the query you can get hundereds of results, so instead of printing them all to the
users console it's been limited to 3 by default. That number can change if you specify using this option; ex `throne pdb ix AMS-IX --count 10`. Whatever number
you specify after --count will be the maximum number of results returned. 

Using `-u`/`--unformatted` will return the results in a more ugly fashion. By default all commands output in a "prettier" format, this turns that off and gives
you what PeeringDB provides throne prior to parsing/processing.

Let's take a look at the base command and see what we get when we search for `AMS-IX`.

```bash title="Example - AMS-IX"
[user@throne ~]$ throne pdb ix AMS-IX
---PeeringDB Results---

```

From the above output we can see we were provided `3` results because we didn't specify the `--count` option. Along with that we're provided some good information
on the IX.

- Name - The name of the IX in PeeringDB
- Location - The location the IX is out of (City, Country)
- Media Type - The registered media type of the IX
- Supported Protocol Types - Which protocols this IX supports
- Tech Contact/Policy Contact - Contacts registered with the IX
- Total Networks - Total number of peers/networks with this IX
- Traffic Stats - The registered traffic stats URL with this IX (The URL may not work, it is dependant on the IX to keep that up to date in PeeringDB)

Now lets see what happens if we up the count to provide a maximum of `10` results.

```bash title="Example - AMS-IX (10)"
[user@throne ~]$ throne pdb ix AMS-IX --count 10

We can see that throne only returned 6 results as that is all it could find for `AMS-IX` in PeeringDB. Just a reminder the number provided to `--count` is a maximum
number to be returned, not the exact number of results returned.

If you don't like the format that throne is providng the information you can always ask for it to be unformatted with the `--unformatted` option.

```bash title="Example - AMS-IX (Unformatted)"
[user@throne ~]$ throne pdb ix AMS-IX --unformatted

While you do get a couple more variables returned when you use `--unformatted`, it's not always the best to use this command. It's a little harder to read
when comparing it to thrones output. The additional variables provided by the `--unformatted` command were left out of throne due to them normally not
containing information such as `Ixf_net_count` or the `Notes` field.
