title: Using the WHOIS query
sidebar_label: GET - WHOIS
description: Getting WHOIS related information

### Getting Started

Getting started with our throne WHOIS API is pretty straight forward. You just need to send a `GET` request to `https://api.throne.dev/api/whois?domain=XXXXXXX`

### Returned Results

The results returned from the throne WHOIS API will be returned in a format that should be very easy to parse compared to a normal RDAP query. Lets take a look at what results get returned when we query for amazon.com. 

Endpoint: `https://api.throne.dev/api/whois?domain=amazon.com`

You may do what you wish with the results that are returned, we created this primarily for [our WHOIS module](/docs/throne-cli-whois) but have decided to make it public. Eventually we plan on making the source code for the API public but at the moment it's a bit dirty.
