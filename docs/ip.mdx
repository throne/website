thrones IP module has two primary functions, `geo` and `info`. 

```bash title="Help"
[user@throne ~]$ throne ip
Usage: throne ip [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Retrieve IP related information.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  geo   Retrieves geolocation information for a specified IP address.
  info  Retrieves IP and registered contact information.
```

### ip geo

The ip geo command has one argument for it and that is an IP address needs to be specified. It will then query out and get geolocation information
for the IP specified.

```bash title="Example"
[user@throne ~]$ throne ip geo 1.1.1.1
IP Address: 1.1.1.1
AS Number: AS13335 Cloudflare, Inc.
ISP: Cloudflare, Inc
Organization: APNIC and Cloudflare DNS Resolver project
---
Location: South Brisbane, QLD, AU
Lat/Long: -27.4766/153.0166
Timezone: Australia/Brisbane
```

Looking at the output above we can see that this command will output a few things for us.

- IP Address - The IP that was queried
- AS Number - The AS number and holder that is advertising the specified IP
- ISP - The name of the organization identified as the "ISP". This will typically also be whoever whos the AS number above
- Organization - The API used returns this variable, it appears to grab the first description line for the inetnum/inet6num object
- Location - The location this IP is registered out of. This may differ from what the RIR has if the IP owner has requested it be updated in DBs such as MaxMind
- Lat/Long - The latitude and longitude of the location above
- Timezone - The timezone that the location above is located in

## ip info

The ip info command has one option and an argument that must be specified. You can use the `-a`/`--all` option with this command to output additional BGP info
for the argument. The argument here can be an IP address or a prefix.

```bash title="Help"
[user@throne ~]$ throne ip info --help
Usage: throne ip info [OPTIONS] IP_OR_PREFIX

  Retrieves IP and registered contact information.

Options:
  -a, --all  Gets IP + BGP info
  --help     Show this message and exit.
```

Lets see how this works without specifying the `-a` option.

```bash title="Example"
[user@throne ~]$ throne ip info 1.1.1.1
---IP Info---

Status: ASSIGNED PORTABLE
Name: APNIC-LABS
CIDR: 1.1.1.0/24
 Announced: True
 Announced By: 13335

 Beginning: 1.1.1.0
 Ending: 1.1.1.255
---APNIC/1.1.1.0 - 1.1.1.255 Contact Information---

```

This output looks fairly similar to the output for `throne bgp asn` but provides us the information about an IP not an ASN.

- Issued By - The RIR who issued this IP/prefix
- Status - The status of the prefix
- Name - The name of the prefix registered with the RIR
- CIDR - The CIDR notation for this IP/Prefix
    - Announced - True/False; if the IP/prefix is announced/seen in a global routing table
    - Announced by - What AS number is originating this prefix
    - Version - Tells us if this is a v4 or v6 IP/prefix
    - Beginning - The beginning of the prefix
    - Ending - The end of the prefix
- Contact Information
    - X(ROLE): - In our example we see `IRT-APNICRANDNET-AU (Abuse)` and `APNIC RESEARCH (Administrative/Technical)`. throne will parse 
    the readable name of each contact and their role and provide it as a header for the group/individual.
    - Entity Address: The address the RIR has on-file for the contact
    - Entity Phone: The phone number the RIR has on-file for the contact
    - Entity Email: The email the RIR has on-file for the contact

Now lets take a look at what we get when we specify the `-a` or `--all` option.

```bash Title="Example - --all"
[user@throne ~]$ throne ip info 1.1.1.1 --all

```

Looking at this output when you specify `-a` or `--all` it's a combination of two commands; `throne ip info` and `throne bgp asn`.

Please review documentation for both of those commands to understand what this output is providing.
