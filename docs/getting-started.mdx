## Installation

Installing throne is easy! You'll need a couple prerequisites to install today.

* Git
* Python >= 3.6
* Pip (for python3) >= 9.0.3

### Prerequisite Install

<Tabs
  defaultValue="rhel"
  values={[
    { label: 'RHEL/CentOS', value: 'rhel' },
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' }]}>

<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
sudo yum install -y git python3 python3-pip
```
Additionally, if you're running CentOS 8+ you can install using dnf:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git python3 python3-pip
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
sudo apt install -y git python3.6-dev python3-pip
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Throne Installation

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pypi"
  values={[
    { label: 'PyPi', value: 'pypi' },
    { label: 'From Source', value: 'source' }]}>

<TabItem value="pypi">

You can install throne from PyPi using the command below.

```bash
pip install throne
```

:::caution Installing from PyPi
When installing throne from PyPi to a WSL machine, you may need to add /home/$USER/local/.bin to your path variable.
This can be done by doing `export PATH="/home/$USER/local/.bin:$PATH"`. Make sure to replace $USER with the username
you're installing under on your system. Your system may not have the $USER variable set.

<TabItem value="source">

Once you have the prerequisites installed you can clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/throne/throne-cli
```

After the repository is cloned, go into its folder and run `pip3 setup.py .`

```bash
cd throne-cli
```
```bash
pip3 setup.py .
```

:::caution Installing from source
When installing throne from source, ensure you're using `pip/pip3 setup.py .` and not `python/python3 setup.py install`.
Running the latter will cause errors when attempting to run the `throne` command. If you do install
using the python install version you can run the pip version afterwards to overwrite and resolve errors.
